## subdomain enumerator
```py
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("subdomains.txt").read() 
subdoms = sub_list.splitlines()

for sub in subdoms:
    sub_domains = f"http://{sub}.{sys.argv[1]}" 

    try:
        requests.get(sub_domains)
    
    except requests.ConnectionError: 
        pass
    
    else:
        print("Valid domain: ",sub_domains)   

```


## Directory Enumeration
```py

import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("wordlist.txt").read() 
directories = sub_list.splitlines()

for dir in directories:
    dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html" 
    r = requests.get(dir_enum)
    if r.status_code==404: 
        pass
    else:
        print("Valid directory:" ,dir_enum)

# python3 dir_enum.py 10.10.10.10
```



## Port Scanner

```py
import sys
import socket
import pyfiglet


ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
print(ascii_banner)


ip = '192.168.1.6' 
open_ports =[] 

ports = range(1, 65535)


def probe_port(ip, port, result = 1): 
  try: 
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
    sock.settimeout(0.5) 
    r = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))   
    if r == 0: 
      result = r 
    sock.close() 
  except Exception as e: 
    pass 
  return result


for port in ports: 
    sys.stdout.flush() 
    response = probe_port(ip, port) 
    if response == 0: 
        open_ports.append(port) 
    

if open_ports: 
  print ("Open Ports are: ") 
  print (sorted(open_ports)) 
else: 
  print ("Looks like no ports are open :(")
```


## File Downloader
```py

import requests

url = 'https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/THMlogo.png'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('THMlogo.png', 'wb').write(r.content)

```

notes:
PSexec allow system administrators to run commands on remote Windows systems. We see that PSexec is also used in cyber attacks as it is usually not detected by antivirus software. You can learn more about PSexec here and read this blogpost about its use by attackers

## Hash Cracker

```py
import hashlib
import pyfiglet

ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \n HASH CRACKER for MD 5")
print(ascii_banner)

wordlist_location = str(input('Enter wordlist file location: '))
hash_input = str(input('Enter hash to be cracked: '))

with open(wordlist_location, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        hash_ob = hashlib.md5(line.strip().encode())
        hashed_pass = hash_ob.hexdigest()
        if hashed_pass == hash_input:
            print('Found cleartext password! ' + line.strip())
            exit(0)
```
This script will require two inputs: the location of the wordlist and the hash value.

As you probably know, hash values can not be cracked as they do not contain the cleartext value. Unlike encrypted values that can be "reversed" (e.g. decrypted), cleartext values for hashes can only be found starting with a list of potential cleartext values. A simplified process can be seen below;

- You retrieve the hash value "eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3" from a database, which you suspect is the hash for a number between 1 and 5.
- You create a file with possible cleartext values (numbers from 1 to 5)
- You generate a list of hashes for values in the cleartext list (Hash values for numbers between 1 and 5)
- You compare the generated hash with the hash value at hand (Matches hash value of the number 3)


## KeyLoggers
```py
# pip3 install keyboard
# Must be Sudo, must have access/permission to accessibility

import keyboard
keys = keyboard.record(until ='ENTER')
print("[+] Recorded Key Strokes")
print(keys)
keyboard.play(keys)
```
